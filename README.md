Abstract:
Performance of face liveness detection algorithms in cross-database face liveness detection tests is one of the key issues in face-biometric based systems. Recently, Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) classifiers have shown remarkable performance in intra-database face liveness detection tests.
In this report, we propose an efficient strategy for training deep CNN classifiers for face liveness detection task. 
In this project, we have to give an input image, weâ€™ll train a Convolutional Neural Network capable of distinguishing real faces from fake/spoofed faces as shown in figure:
